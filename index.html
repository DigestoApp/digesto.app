        <h1>AI & How We Use It</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>Imagine you have a big box of LEGO bricks. Each LEGO brick is a tiny piece of news - like a story about a new toy or a fun game. Now, we want to build different sets out of these LEGO bricks. Each set is a big story made up of smaller news stories that are similar, like all the stories about playing at the park go together, and all the stories about ice cream flavors go into another set.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Sorting LEGO Bricks (News Articles):</strong> First, we take all our LEGO bricks and look at them one by one. We read the little stories on them and decide what kind of story they are. We put aside the bricks that are just people's opinions or make-believe because we want our sets to be real and important.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Building Sets (Grouping Articles into Stories):</strong> Next, we start building our sets. We find bricks that are about the same thing, like all the bricks about going to the zoo, and we put them together to make a zoo set. We do this until we have lots of different sets, like one for the zoo, one for the beach, one for ice cream, and so on.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Naming Our Sets (Titling the Stories):</strong> After we've built our sets, we give each one a name that tells us what it's about, but we have to keep the names short, like "Fun at the Zoo" or "Ice Cream Adventure." The name helps us remember what story the set tells.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Telling the Story (Summarizing the Articles):</strong> Now, we want to tell a story with our set, so we look at all the bricks in it and think about what they show us together. We tell a short story that explains everything about our set, so anyone else who sees it will understand what it's about without having to look at each brick.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Where Did It Happen? (Location):</strong> We also say where our story happened, like in our city, another country, or maybe it's a story that could happen anywhere in the world.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Putting It All Together (Organizing the Stories):</strong> Last, we organize our sets by how important they are, putting the biggest, most important stories at the front, like a huge castle or a spaceship, and the smaller ones, like a little garden or a puppy, toward the back.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>We do all this carefully and make sure we have at least 12 different sets (stories) to show, each with its own special name, story, where it happened, and a little tag that tells us which LEGO bricks (articles) we used to build it. And we keep our sets in a big box (in a special format) so we can share them with others easily!</p>
        
        <p>PS, all of our AI generated stories are open source and available in an API!</p>
